# XMLUtilities

This project was an idea to make my own XML reader/writer (parser) to understand how basic parsing works and also to use it in my projects because of the very small size. This project will do normal parsing just fine. It won't validate like a top XML parser would but gets the job done.
 Intended for small and medium projects because it stores everything in XMLDocument which eats up memory. Before using this know that you should use as it is intended or expect things to go wrong easily. It does
 not offer serialization because i felt that it is up to the developer to implement his serialization system. Although i might make a serialization functionality on top of it.

You can use it in any project you want and it is MIT licensed.
