# XMLUtilities

This project was an idea of me to make my own XML reader/writer (parser) to understand how basic parsing works and also to use it in my projects because of the size. This project will do normal parsing just fine. It won't validate like a top XML parser would but gets the job done. Intended for small and medium projects because it stores everything in XMLDocument.

You can use it in any project you want and it is MIT licensed.

Roadmap:
-Add Serialization
